# Dissecting American Fuzzy Lop - A FuzzBench Evaluation

This repo contains the code in the AFL/ folder and the artifacts to reproduce the experiments in the fuzzbench/ folder.

To build all the AFL variants used in the paper follow the readme in the AFL/ folder, to run the experiments follow the fuzzbench documentation.

You can upload the fuzzers config (the folders in fuzzbench/fuzzers/) to the FuzzBench service opening a PR and request an experiment (https://google.github.io/fuzzbench/getting-started/adding-a-new-fuzzer/#requesting-an-experiment) to reproduce our results.

Instead, to run the experiments locally, follow https://google.github.io/fuzzbench/running-a-local-experiment.
